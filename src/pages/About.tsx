              <p>Beans and Roots was founded in 2025 by Clairia Vaughn in Sanford, Florida.</p>
              <p>What started as a small pop-up kava bar has grown into a beloved community space where people come to relax, socialize, and enjoy botanical beverages in a welcoming, alcohol-free environment.</p>
              <p>Our name "Beans and Roots" pays homage to the roots of the kava plant and the coffee beans that inspire our warm, caf√©-like atmosphere. We've created a space that bridges traditional kava culture with modern comfort.</p>
